<h1>Welcome to Apache Sandesha2</h1>

<p>Sandesha2 is an implementation of <a
href="ftp://www6.software.ibm.com/software/developer/library/ws-reliablemessaging200502.pdf" target="_blank">WS-ReliableMessaging
specification</a> published by IBM, Microsoft, BEA and TIBCO. Sandesha2 was
built on top of Axis2. Therefore by using Sandesha2 you can add reliable
messaging capability to the web services hosted using Axis2. Sandesha2 can
also be used with Axis2 client to interact with already hosted web services
in a reliable manner. Please see sandesha2 user guide for more information on
