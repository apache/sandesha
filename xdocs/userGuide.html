<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 is a Web Service-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) implementation for
Apache Axis2. With Sandesha2 you can make your Web services reliable, or you
can invoke already hosted reliable Web services.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about Apache Axis2, refer to <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/0_95/userguide.html">Apache Axis2 User
Guide</a> and <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/0_95/Axis2ArchitectureGuide.html">Apache
Axis2 Architecture Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to know about the design of Sandesha2 refer to <a
href="architectureGuide.html">Sandesha2 Architecture Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Sandesha2 supports two reliable messaging specifications. It fully
supports WS-ReliableMessaging Feabruary 2005 specification which was created
in collaboration with Microsoft, IBM, BEA and TOBCO Software. Later this
specification was submitted to OASIS and is currently being standerdized
under the OASIS WS-RX technical committee. Sandesha2 currently support up to
the revision CD 3 of the specification being developed under this technical
committee.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Your First Service with Sandesha2</h2>

<p>This section will give you step by step guidelines on createting a Web
service with reliability and making it available within your Axis2 server.
This simple service will have a single one-way operation (ping) and a
request-response operation (echoString).</p>

<p>The steps are as follows:"</p>

<p>1. Download the Axis2 Webapp distribution (Axis2.war file) and deploy it
within Tomcat. Extract the webapp so that you can edit the files of the
webapp. (this will also be done if you run tomcat with the axis2.war file
within the webapps folder).</p>

<p>2. Add a user phase named RMPhase to the inFlow, outFlow of inFaultFlow of
the axis2.xml file which is situated under the webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/conf
directory. The 'Phases' part of a axis2.xml file with RMPhase is given
below.</p>
<pre>&lt;axisconfig name="AxisJava2.0"&gt;
    &lt;!-- OTHER PARTS OF THE CONFIGURATOIN--&gt;
    &lt;phaseOrder type="inflow"&gt;
         &lt;phase name="Transport"&gt;
            &lt;!-- TRANSPORT PHASE HANDLERS--&gt;
        &lt;/phase&gt;
        &lt;phase name="Security"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="PreDispatch"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="Dispatch" class="org.apache.axis2.engine.DispatchPhase"&gt;
            &lt;!-- DISPATCH PHASE HANDLERS--&gt;
        &lt;/phase&gt;
        &lt;phase name="OperationInPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="RMPhase"/&gt;
    &lt;/phaseOrder&gt;
    &lt;phaseOrder type="outflow"&gt;
        &lt;phase name="RMPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="OperationOutPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="PolicyDetermination"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="MessageOut"/&gt;
    &lt;/phaseOrder&gt;
    &lt;phaseOrder type="INfaultflow"&gt;
        &lt;phase name="PreDispatch"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="Dispatch" class="org.apache.axis2.engine.DispatchPhase"&gt;
            &lt;!-- DISPATCH PHASE HANDLERS--&gt;
        &lt;/phase&gt;
        &lt;phase name="OperationInFaultPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="RMPhase"/&gt;
    &lt;/phaseOrder&gt;
    &lt;phaseOrder type="Outfaultflow"&gt;
        &lt;!--      user can add his own phases to this area  --&gt;
        &lt;phase name="RMPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="OperationOutFaultPhase"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="PolicyDetermination"/&gt;
        &lt;phase name="MessageOut"/&gt;
    &lt;/phaseOrder&gt;
&lt;/axisconfig&gt;</pre>

<p>2 Get a Sandesha2 binary distribution. Extract this to obtain the sandesha
module file (which has the format sandesha2-&lt;VERSION&gt;.mar). Put this to
the webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/modules directory.</p>

<p>3. Create the service implementation java file as given below. Compile
this after adding all the libraries within the webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/lib
directory to your classpath.</p>

<p><em><strong>RMSampleService.java</strong></em></p>
<pre>package sandesha2.samples.userguide;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import javax.xml.namespace.QName;
import org.apache.axiom.om.OMAbstractFactory;
import org.apache.axiom.om.OMElement;
import org.apache.axiom.om.OMFactory;
import org.apache.axiom.om.OMNamespace;

public class RMSampleService {

    private static Map sequenceStrings = new HashMap();  //TODO make this non static
    private final String applicationNamespaceName = "http://tempuri.org/"; 
    private final String Text = "Text";
    private final String Sequence = "Sequence";
    private final String echoStringResponse = "echoStringResponse";
    private final String EchoStringReturn = "EchoStringReturn";
  
    public OMElement echoString(OMElement in) throws Exception {

        OMElement textElem = in.getFirstChildWithName(new QName (applicationNamespaceName,Text));
        OMElement sequenceElem = in.getFirstChildWithName(new QName (applicationNamespaceName,Sequence));

        if (textElem==null)
            throw new Exception ("'Text' element is not present as a child of the 'echoString' element");
        if (sequenceElem==null)
            throw new Exception ("'Sequence' element is not present as a child of the 'echoString' element");

        String textStr = textElem.getText();
        String sequenceStr = sequenceElem.getText();

        System.out.println("'EchoString' service got text '" + textStr + "' for the sequence '" + sequenceStr + "'");

        String previousText = (String) sequenceStrings.get(sequenceStr);
        String resultText = (previousText==null)?textStr:previousText+textStr;
        sequenceStrings.put(sequenceStr,resultText);

        OMFactory fac = OMAbstractFactory.getOMFactory();
        OMNamespace applicationNamespace = fac.createOMNamespace(applicationNamespaceName,"ns1");
        OMElement echoStringResponseElem = fac.createOMElement(echoStringResponse, applicationNamespace);
        OMElement echoStringReturnElem = fac.createOMElement(EchoStringReturn, applicationNamespace);

        echoStringReturnElem.setText(resultText);
        echoStringResponseElem.addChild(echoStringReturnElem);

        return echoStringResponseElem;
    }
  
    public void ping(OMElement in) throws Exception  {
        OMElement textElem = in.getFirstChildWithName(new QName (applicationNamespaceName,Text));
        if (textElem==null)
            throw new Exception ("'Text' element is not present as a child of the 'Ping' element");

        String textValue = textElem.getText();

        System.out.println("ping service got text:" + textValue);
    }
}</pre>

<p>4. Create the services.xml service configiration file as given below. Note
that this has engaged the sandesha2 module for this service.</p>

<p><em><strong>services.xml</strong></em></p>
<pre>&lt;service name="RMSampleService"&gt;
   &lt;parameter name="ServiceClass" locked="xsd:false"&gt;sandesha2.samples.userguide.RMSampleService&lt;/parameter&gt;

   &lt;module ref="sandesha2" /&gt;

   &lt;description&gt;
        The userguide Sample service.
   &lt;/description&gt;

   &lt;operation name="ping" mep="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-only"&gt; 
       &lt;messageReceiver class="org.apache.axis2.receivers.RawXMLINOnlyMessageReceiver" /&gt;
   &lt;/operation&gt;  
   &lt;operation name="echoString"&gt;
       &lt;messageReceiver class="org.apache.axis2.receivers.RawXMLINOutMessageReceiver" /&gt;
   &lt;/operation&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;</pre>

<p>5. Set RMSampleService.class and the services.xml files obtained from the
previous steps in the folder structure below. Create a RMInteropService.aar
file by compressing it using the jar tool.</p>
<pre>----META-INF
--------services.xml
----sandesha2
-------samples
-----------userguide
---------------RMSampleService.class</pre>

<p>6. Deploy the service by dropping it to the webapp/axis2/WEB-INF/services
directory.</p>

<p>Now your service is deployed with reliable messaging capability!</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Writing Clients for Reliable Services</h2>

<p>1. Create a repository folder in your file system (let's call it Client
Repo).</p>

<p>2.Put the client_axis2.xml file that comes with the Sandesha2
distributions to the Client Repo.</p>

<p>2. Create a sub folder named 'modules' in the Client Repo and add the
sandesha and addressing module files to that. Your folder structure should
look like following now.</p>
<pre>-- Client Repo  
------ client_axis2.xml
-------modules
-------------sandesha2.mar
-------------addressing.mar</pre>

<p>3. Write your client code as given in the following example scenarios. In
these scenarios the variable CLIENT_REPO_PATH should be given the full path
to the Client Repo folder in a java compatible manner. To compile these you
will have to add all the library files that come with the Axis2 distribution
and the sandesha2-client-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar file to your classpath.</p>

<p>For e.g.:</p>
<pre>CLIENT_REPO_PATH = c:\\sandesha2\\repository</pre>

}</pre>

<p><em>Lst's find out the differences between this code and a client code
without RM:</em></p>

<p>You have to engage the sandesha and addressing modules. This has to be
done only if your axis2.xml file does not globally add these. For example, if
you are using the axis2_client.xml as in the previous file that comes with
the Sandesha2 distribution, these two lines have to be omitted. Otherwise
Axis2 will through the exception "org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Trying to
engage a module which is already engaged".</p>
<a></a>

<p>Before the last invocation you have to set the LAST_MESSAGE property.
Otherwise the sequence will not terminate properly.</p>

}</pre>

<p><em><strong>Here the differences from a normal request-reply client code
is as follows:</strong></em></p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the previous scenario to do the module
engagement correctly.</p>

<p>You have to tell Axis2 to use a separate channel for the responses by
using 'useSeperateListner' method of the options object. Also make sure that
you set the incoming transport protocol using the 'setTransportInProtocol'
method.</p>

<p>Also you have to set the LAST_MESSAGE property as explained in the
previous scenario.</p>

<p>In the current implementation you are not able to get single channel
responses with Sandesha2. Because of this if you expect a response message,
you must have a return endpoint accessible from the server side. But making
two channel blocking invocations is perfectly valid. But make sure that you
have set a suitable timeout interval in your options object.</p>

<p></p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Advance Client Scenarios</h2>

<p>This section will introduce you to some Client API features which you may
not use for general cases. These features will be useful if you have some
knowledge in WSRM (Web service Reliable Messaging) and if you want to
customize the default behavior of Sandesha2 to make it work according to your
requirements. Some of these have to be done by simply setting a property in
the 'Options' object which you set to your ServiceClient. For these you have
to add the sandesha2-client-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar to your classpath. For
others, you have to use a special class called SandeshaClient, which is
available in the Sandesha-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar file. Both these comes with
Sandesha2 distributions.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3><b>Getting Acknowledgements and Faults to a Given Endpoint</b></h3>

<p>In the default configuration, response path for acknowledgements and
faults related to a sequence is the anonymous endpoint. For example, HTTP
transport will send acknowledgements and faults in the HTTP response of
request messages. If you want to avoid this and if you want to get
acknowledgements and faults to a different endpoint, add following part to
the client code before doing any invocation. Note that this does not effect
the path of you application level faults. Only RM faults which occur within
the Sandesha2 will be sent to this endpoint.</p>
<pre>clientOptions.setProperty(SandeshaClientConstants.AcksTo,&lt;endpoint&gt;); //example endpoint - http://tempuri.org/acks.</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3><b>Managing Sequences</b></h3>

<p>In the default behaviour Sandesha2 assumes that messages going to the same
endpoint should go in the same RM sequence. Messages will be sent in
different RM sequences only if their WS-Addressing To address is different.
But if required you can instruct Sandesha2 to even send messages that have
the same WS-Addressing To address in two or more sequences. To do this you
have to set a property called Sequence Key.</p>
<pre>clientOptions.setProperty(SandeshaClientConstants.SEQUENCE_KEY,&lt;a string to identify the sequence&gt;);</pre>

<p>If the sequence key is different, Sandesha2 will send messages in two
sequences even if they are sent to the same endpoint.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Offering a Sequence ID for the Response Sequence</h3>

<p>This is a concept of reliable messaging which may not be very useful to
you as a end user. Here what you do is offering a sequence ID for the
sequence to be created in the response side within the Create Sequence
Request message of the request path. If you provide this and if the Sandesha2
server accepts the offered sequence ID it can refrain from doing the Create
Sequence message exchange in the response path. To do this, add the following
to the client code.</p>
<pre>clientOptions.setProperty(SandeshaClientConstants.OFFERED_SEQUENCE_ID,&lt;new uuid&gt;);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Creating a Sequence Without Sending any Messages</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may need Sandesha2 client to start a sequence with a server
without sending any real application messages. When you ask for this,
Sandesha2 will do a Create Sequence message exchange and obtain a new
sequence ID from the server. Later you can send application messages with
this newly created sequence. A boolean parameter in this can also be used to
tell whether to send an offer (Read the previous part on <a
href="#oas">offering sequence IDs</a> to learn more about this) . The line
you have to add to your client code for doing these is as follows.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.createSequence (ServiceClient serviceClient, booleanoffer);</pre>

<p>There is another method which takes a third parameter, which is the
Sequence Key (Read the previous part on Sequence Keys to learn more about
this). So with this you can create two or more sequences which can be
identified from different Sequence Keys.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.createSequnce (ServiceClient serviceClient, boolean offer,
String sequenceKey);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Sending Acknowledgement Requests from the Client Code</h3>

<p>You can ask the Sandesha2 to get an acknowledgement from a server with
which it is maintaining a sequence. This may be useful in a case where your
<a href="#sequencereport">SequenceReports</a> indicate that some of the
messages you sent have not been acknowledged and when you want to verify
that. You can do this by adding one of the following line to the client
code.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.sendAckRequest (ServiceClient serviceClient);</pre>

<p>You can use following method to send an acknowledgement request to a
specific sequence identified by the Sequence Key.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.sendAckRequest (ServiceClient serviceClient, String sequenceKey);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Selecting the Specification Version Which you Want to Work in</h3>

<p>As I explained earlier Sandesha2 supports two WSRM specifications. The
default is the submitted WSRM specification. But if you want to change this
and work in the new OASIS WSRM specification, set the following property in
the Options object.</p>
<pre>clientOptions.setProperty(SandeshaClient.RM_SPEC_VERSION,Sandesha2Constants.SPEC_VERSIONS.WSRX);</pre>

<p>To go back to the WSRM submitted specification set the property as
follows.</p>
<pre>clientOptions.setProperty(SandeshaClient.RM_SPEC_VERSION,Sandesha2Constants.SPEC_VERSIONS.WSRM);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Terminating a Sequence from the Client Code</h3>

<p>You can terminate an on going sequence at any time by adding the line
given in this section to your client code. Remember that if you terminate a
sequence some of your messages may not get delivered to the service. This is
the recommended way for old WSRM submitted specification (the default). See
the section '<a href="#smo">Sequence Management of Sandesha2</a>' for more
details.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.terminateSequence (ServiceClient serviceClient);</pre>

<p>To terminate a specific sequence use following.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.terminateSequence (ServiceClient serviceClient, String sequenceKey);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Closing a Sequence from the Client Code</h3>

<p>You can close an ongoing sequence at any time by adding the line given in
this section to your client code. Sequence close feature is only available
for new WSRM specification being developed under OASIS. Remember that if you
do not close elegantly, some of your messages may not get delivered to the
service. Again, see the section on <a href="#smo">Sequence Management of
Sandesha2</a> for more details. You can issue following command from your
client code to close a sequence.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.closeSequence (ServiceClient serviceClient);</pre>

<p>To close a specific sequence use following.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.closeSequence (ServiceClient serviceClient, String sequenceKey);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Blocking the Client Code until a Sequence is Complete</h3>

<p>After your client code delivered some messages to the RM layer, you may
have to wait for some time until the RM layer does its work. The time you
have to block depends on your system performance and network latencies. It
may be easier to ask the RM layer to block until its work is done by issuing
one of the following commands in your client code.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.waitUntilSequenceCompleted (ServiceClient serviceClient);

SandeshaClient.waitUntilSequenceCompleted (ServiceClient serviceClient, String sequenceKey);</pre>

<p>You can also give the maximum number of seconds the RM Layer should block.
The blocking will stop at the end of this maximum time even if the sequence
is not terminated or not timed out. But note that internally RM is still
working. So even though the blocking stops, RM layer will continue its work
until you exit the program.</p>

<h2>Sequence Management of Sandesha2</h2>

<p>This section will explain you about the sequence managing method of
Sandesha2. This is basically about four things, each explained in following
sub topics.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Starting a New Sequence</h3>

<p>Sandesha client gets two properties given by the client to decide the
sequence in which it should send a particular application messages. First one
is the address of the WS-Addressing To endpoint reference. The second is a
special constant given by the client called Sequence Key which is set as a
property in the Options object as I explained before. Sandesha2 client
generates a value called Internal Sequence ID by combining these two values.
All messages having the same Internal Sequence ID will be sent in a single
sequence, until that particular sequence is terminated.</p>

<p>Sequences that carry messages from the client to a server are called
request sequences and ones that carry messages from the server to the client
are called response sequences. Sandesha2 always keep a single response
sequence corresponding to a particular request sequence.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Terminating a Sequence</h3>

<p>There are currently two methods to terminate a particular sequence from
the Client API. The first method is to set the Last Message propertyas it was
explained <a href="#lastmessage">earlier</a>. After all the messages up to
the last message get delivered reliably Sandesha2 will terminate that
sequence. Remember that if you are working on the Submitted WSRM
specification (the default), this is the only method you can use.</p>

<p>If you are working on the new WSRM specification (see previous section on
<a href="#sts">Selecting the Specification Version</a> if you want to know
how to set this), these is a alternate method you can use to terminate a
sequence. You can keep invoking the ServiceClient to send messages, without
setting a Last Message property. After you finish your work call following
function to terminate the sequence.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.terminateSequence (ServiceClient);</pre>

<p>You can use the function below to terminate a sequence identified by a
particular Sequence Key.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.terminateSequence (ServiceClient,, SequenceKey);</pre>

<p>When a request sequence is terminated, Sandesha2 will wait till all the
response messages are reliably delivered to the client and after which will
terminate the response sequence as well.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>Closing a Sequence</h3>

<p>New WSRM specification being developed under OASIS introduces a new
feature called closing a sequence. When a sequence is closed the server will
not except new application messages, but will accept RM control messages like
acknowledgement requests. If you are writing your code for this specification
you can use following functions to close the current sequence.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.closeSequence (ServiceClient);</pre>

<p>You can use the function below to close a sequence identified by a
particular Sequence Key.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.terminateSequence (ServiceClient,, SequenceKey);</pre>
<a></a> <a href=""></a>

<h3>Timing Out a Sequence</h3>

<p>Depending on its policy configurations Sandesha2 may time out certain
sequences. When a sequence is timed out, it is considered finalized and
cannot be used any more. There are basically two ways a sequence can time
out, and both can be configured using policies. See '<a
href="#inactivitytimeout">InactivityTimeout</a>' and '<a
href="#maximumretransmissioncount">MaximumRetransmissionCount</a>' parts of
the '<a href="#cs">Configuring Sandesha2</a>' sub topic for more details.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Working with Sandesha Reports</h2>

<p>Sandesha introduces a feature called Sandesha Reports with which you can
get status information about the sequences managed by Sandesha2. There are
basically two kinds of reports, each explained in following subtopics.</p>
<a></a> <a href=""></a>

<h3>SandeshaReport</h3>

<p>This gives information on all the incoming and outgoing sequences
Sandesha2 system is managing. When we consider a particular endpoint, an
incoming sequence is a sequence to which that endpoint is working as a
RM-Destination (RMD). An outgoing sequence is a sequence to which this
endpoint works as a RM-Source (RMS).</p>

<p><em><strong>A SandeshaReport include following
information:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sequence IDs of all the outgoing sequences.</li>
  <li>Number of completed messages of each outgoing sequences.</li>
  <li>Sequence IDs of all the incoming sequences.</li>
  <li>No of completed messages of each incoming sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a SandeshaReport at any time, invoke following method from your
client code.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.getSandeshaReport (ConfigurationContext c);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>SequenceReport</h3>

<p>A SequnceReport gives information on a specific sequences that a Sandesha
system is working on. This can be an incoming sequence or a outgoing
sequence.</p>

<p><em><strong>A SequenceReport will give following
information:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Status of the sequence which can be one of the following.
    <ul>
      <li>INITIAL - The sequence has not been established yet.</li>
      <li>ESTABLISHED - Create Sequence / Create Sequence Response message
        exchange has been done.</li>
      <li>TERMINATED - The sequence has been terminated.</li>
      <li>TIMEDOUT - The sequence has timed out.</li>
      <li>UNKNOWN - The status cannot be determined.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequence Direction
    <ul>
      <li>OUT - Outgoing sequence</li>
      <li>IN - Incoming sequence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequence ID of the sequence</li>
  <li>Internal sequence ID of the sequence.</li>
  <li>Number of completed messages of the sequence.</li>
</ol>

<p>A messages is considered as <strong>completed</strong> when a RMS has
successfully sent the message to the RMD and received an acknowledgement.</p>

<p>To get an incoming sequence report, you have to issue following command
from your client code.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.getIncomingSequenceReports (ConfigurationContext configCtx);</pre>

<p>To get an outgoing Sequence Report you can invoke any of the following
functions.</p>
<pre>SandeshaClient.getOutgoingSequenceReport (ServiceClient serviceClient);
SandeshaClient.getOutgoingSequenceReport (String to,String sequenceKey,ConfigurationContext configurationContext);
SandeshaClient.getOutgoingSequenceReport (String internalSequenceID,ConfigurationContext configurationContext);</pre>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Sandesha Listener Feature</h2>

<p>You can use this new feature to register a listener class in Sandesha2 and
get notified when specific event happens in the system. The basic interface
is given below.</p>
<pre>public interface SandeshaListener {
    public void onError(AxisFault fault);
    public void onTimeOut(SequenceReport report);
}</pre>

<p>You can implement this class and set an object of that type as a property
in the Options object in your client code. An example is given below.</p>
<pre>options.setProperty (SandeshaClientConstants.SANDESHA_LISTENER, new SandeshaListnerImpl ());</pre>

<p>Currently SandeshaListener defines the following two methods- onError
&amp; onTimedOut.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>onError</h3>

<p>This will be invoked if Sandesha2 receives a fault SOAP message for one of
the protocol messages it sent. The parameter will be an AxisFault
representing that fault message. Remember that this will not be invoked for
faults that occur due to application messages or any other messages that do
not get originated from Sandesha2. They will not be considered by the
Sandesha2 system as valid application messages.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>onTimeOut</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the earlier section <a href="#smo">Sequence Management of
Sanesha2</a>, there is a possibility of an inactive sequence timing out. When
a specific sequence times out, this method of the SandeshaListener will be
invoked giving a report of that sequence as a parameter.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Delivery Assurances of Sandesha2</h2>

<p>As it was mentioned in the <a href="architectureGuide.html">Architecture
Guide</a>, Sandesha2 provide an in-order exactly-once delivery assurance.
<strong>In-order</strong> means that Sandesha2 will guarantee delivering of
the messages to the Web service in the order of their message numbers. If you
use a Sandesha2 client this will be the order you called the invocation
methods of your service client. <strong>Exactly-once</strong> delivery
assurance means that Sandesha2 will make sure that the service will be
invoked only once for each message. As it was mentioned earlier Sandesha2
retransmits messages to obtain reliability. Due to the exactly-once delivery
assurance you can be sure that your service gets invoked only once.</p>

<p>If you require the performance to be maximized and if you do not want
ordering, you can configure Sandesha2 to invoke messages in the order they
arrive. Read 'Configuring Sandesha2' section below to learn how to do
this.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h2>Configuring Sandesha2</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 provides a set of configurations which you can use to customize
its execution behavior. All these configurations are available in a WS-Policy
format. These policies can be in the module.xml file of the Sandesha module
or in the services.xml file of a service on which Sandesha2 module has been
engaged. Most of the policies in the module.xml can be overridden by setting
different values in a services.xml. But some policies cannot be overridden
and must be set correctly in the module.xml file.</p>

<p>You will find each Sandesha2 policy and the way an alteration of it can
effect Sandesha2. Make sure that you set these values carefully. Setting
incompatible types or values may cause Sandesha system to malfunction.
Normally if Sandesha2 can detect that the value you have set is incompatible,
it will set a default value which is mentioned in the SandeshaConstants
class.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>AcknowledgementInterval</h3>

<p>When a RMD receives an application message and when it has to send
acknowledgements to an endpoint (other than the anonymous URL), it will not
send this message immediately but will wait for some time to see whether
there are any other messages (for example application response messages)
going towards the destination of the acknowledgement message. If it finds
any, the acknowledgement message is piggybacked in this second message and
both are sent together. If the RMD does not find any messages that go towards
the destination of the acknowledgement within a specific time interval, the
acknowledgement is sent as a stand alone message. This time interval is
called the <strong>acknowledgement interval</strong> and can be configured in
Sandesha2 policies. The measurement unit is in milliseconds.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>RetransmissionInterval</h3>

<p>As it was mentioned earlier some messages in RM should be retransmitted
until a proper response or acknowledgement is returned. After sending a
message once, the RMS will wait for some time before sending it for the
second time. This waiting time between the first and second retransmission
attempts is given by this policy. If the policy given later called the
ExponentialBackoff is set to false the time gap between all the
retransmissions attempts will have the same value, which is the
RetransmissionInterval. Measurement unit is in milliseconds.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>ExponentialBackoff</h3>

<p>Value of this can either be 'true' or 'false'. This measure is used to
adjust the retransmission attempts so that an RMD does not get flooded with a
large number of retransmitted messages. If this is 'true', a time gap between
two retransmissions will be twice as the time gap between previous two
retransmissions. For example, if the time gap between the fourth and fifth
retransmission attempts is twenty seconds the time gap between the fifth and
sixth attempts will be forty seconds. If this property is set to 'false', all
retransmissions will have the same value, which is given by the
'RetransmissionInterval' property.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>MaximumRetransmissionCount</h3>

<p>This gives the maximum number of times a message has to be retransmitted.
When a specific message gets retransmitted a maximum number of times, and is
still not sent correctly to the RMD, it will not be sent again and the
request will be marked as Timed Out. When a sequence is timed out, it cannot
be used any more. If the value of this property is '-1' there is no limit in
the number of retransmission attempts.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>InactivityTimeout</h3>

<p>A Sandesha2 RMS always keeps track of the last time a particular RMD
responded to a request by it. If the RMD does not response within the time
limit given by the time interval given by this measure, the RMS will give up
attempting and will mark the sequence as Timed Out. After timing out the
particular sequence, it cannot be used any more. If the value of this is -1,
there is not inactivity timeout limit The measure of this is given by the
property 'InactivityTimeoutMeasure'.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>InactivityTimeoutMeasure</h3>

<p>This gives the measure of the property 'InactivityTimeout'. The value of
this can be seconds, minutes, hours or days. If you give a value that cannot
be interpreted the default will be used.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>InvokeInOrder</h3>

<p>As it was mentioned earlier, Sandesha2 implement the in-order invoking
delivery assurance. This property can be used to turn this on or off. The
value of this has to be 'true' if in-order invoking has to be enabled. It has
to be false if in-order invoking has to be disabled. Please remember that
this is a non-overridable property. I.e. value you set in the module.xml is
the one that is used for all the services and will not be overridden for a
perticular service by setting a different value there.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>StorageManager</h3>

<p>This gives the storage manager implementation class used by Sandesha2. You
have to mention the full qualified class name here. Please read the Sandesha2
<a href="architectureGuide.html">Architecture Guide</a> for more details on
creating your own storage manager. This is also a property that cannot be
overridden, i.e., value you set in the module.xml is the one that is used for
all the services and will not be overridden for a particular service by
setting a different value there.</p>
<a href=""></a>

<h3>MessageTypesToDrop</h3>

<p>This is a property that may not be very useful to an end user, but may be
useful for some debug purposes. As it was mentioned earlier Sandesha2 gives a
Message Type to each message it sends. For example, Create Sequence messages
will have the type 1 and Acknowledgement messages will have the type 4. You
can add a comma separated list of integers in the property telling Sandesha2
not to send messages of those types.</p>
