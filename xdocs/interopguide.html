<h1><font size="6">Interop guide for Apache Sandesha</font></h1>
<p>This document explains the interoperability of apache Sandesha with 
several other well known WS-RM implementations. We will not only show you 
how nicely Sandesha interoperates with them but also how you can test the 
interoperability yourself.</p>

<h2><font size="5">Sandesha client</font></h2>
<p>Sandesha client has successfully interoperated with the WS-RM server 
implementations given below. We have developed client classes for each of
these server endpoints. Please make sure that the server endpoints are 
available before you try to run the client classes. Also make sure that 
your computer has a public IP address available before testing. This will 
be necessary for getting responses from the server. 
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With IBM server</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wsrm/services/rmDemos">http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wsrm/services/rmDemos</a></p>
<p>With IBM we have successfully interoperated both Ping and EchoString clients. 
Classes IBMEcho, IBMAsyncPing and IBMSyncPing can be used to test the interoperability 
with this endpoint. These are available in the package org.apache.sandesha.samples.interop
of the 'test' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With Microsoft server</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://131.107.153.195/SecureReliableMessaging/ReliableOneWayDual.svc">http://131.107.153.195/SecureReliableMessaging/ReliableOneWayDual.svc</a></p>
<p>Sandesha nicely works with above Ping service available from Microsoft.
Classes MicrosoftAsyncPing and MicrosoftSyncPing can be used to test the interoperability 
with this endpoint. These are available in the package org.apache.sandesha.samples.interop 
of the 'test' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With Systinet server</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://soap.systinet.net:6064/Service">http://soap.systinet.net:6064/Service</a></p>
<p>Sandesha has proved its interoperability with the Systinet server as well. 
The client stub classes are SystinetSyncPing and SystinetAsyncPing, available 
in the package org.apache.sandesha.samples.interop  of the 'test' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">Using the test client webapp</font></h3>
<p>We have created a simple web application which you can deploy on tomcat and 
test the interoperability with any available WS-RM server implementation.To build the webapp, 
</p>
<p>Make sure that you have Apache Ant installed in your system. After this go command 
prompt move to the the folder 'interop' and type,</p>
<p>
<source>ant war</source>
</p>
<p>
This will create the sandesha-interop.war file in the subfolder 'dist/war'. Copy this 
to the webapps folder of tomcat and start the tomcat server. Now you are ready to run
the Sandesha interop client. Start your web browser and go to URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/sandesha-interop/interop.jsp">http://localhost:8080/sandesha-interop/interop.jsp</a>
This should show you the interop client web page.
</p>
<p>
Most of the fields in this web page are self-explanaitory. First you can set the 
target field to any valid target URL. After this choose the operation Ping or echoString accordingly. 
The AcksTo field tells weather the acknowledgements are synchronous or asynchronous. 
If acksTo is anonymous the acknowledgements will be sent in a synchronous path. You can also 
set the WS-Addressing fields From, To and ReplyTo. ReplyTo should say where you expect to
receive applications responses. FaultTo URL should point to the location you expect to receive faults.
Finally you can mention weather the client should send a sequence offer which is the sequence 
id of the response path, and the number of appplication messages you wish to send to the server.
</p>
<h2><font size="5">Sandesha Server</font></h2>
<p>We have successfully tested the interoperability of Sandesha server with 
the IBM test client available at <a href="http://ibm_test_client_url">http://ibm_test_client_url</a>
