<h1><font size="6">Interop guide for Apache Sandesha</font></h1>
<p>This document explains the interoperability of apache Sandesha with 
several other well known WS-RM implementations. You can test the interoperability
yourself using the stub classes and the test client web application we 
have provided.</p>

<p>Sandesha client has successfully interoperated with the WS-RM 
implementations given below. We have developed client classes for each of
these endpoints. Please make sure that the server endpoints are 
available before you try to run the client classes. Also make sure that 
your computer can get information back asynchronously. (you may have to make
sure that a firewall is not blocking the response path (default port 9090) and 
you may need to have a public IP address). 
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With IBM implementation</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wsrm/services/rmDemos">http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wsrm/services/rmDemos</a></p>
<p>With IBM we have successfully interoperated both Ping and EchoString scenarios. 
Classes IBMEcho, IBMAsyncPing and IBMSyncPing can be used to test the interoperability 
with this endpoint. These are available in the package org.apache.sandesha.interop
of the 'interop' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With Microsoft implementation</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://131.107.153.195/SecureReliableMessaging/ReliableOneWayDual.svc">http://131.107.153.195/SecureReliableMessaging/ReliableOneWayDual.svc</a></p>
<p>Sandesha interoperated with the above Ping service ednpoints available from Microsoft.
Classes MicrosoftAsyncPing and MicrosoftSyncPing can be used to test the interoperability 
with this endpoint. These are available in the package org.apache.sandesha.interop
of the 'interop' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">With Systinet server</font></h3>
<p>Server endpoint is <a href="http://soap.systinet.net:6064/Service">http://soap.systinet.net:6064/Service</a></p>
<p>Sandesha has also proved to be interoperable with the Systinet server. 
The client stub classes are SystinetSyncPing and SystinetAsyncPing, available 
in the package org.apache.sandesha.interop  of the 'interop' folder.
</p>
<h3><font size="4">Using the test client webapp</font></h3>
<p>We have created a simple web application which you can deploy on tomcat and 
test the interoperability with any available WS-RM server implementation.To build the webapp, 
</p>
<p>Make sure that you have Apache Ant installed in your system. After this go to the the 
folder 'interop' in command prompt and type,</p>
<p>
<source>ant war</source>
</p>
<p>
This will create the sandesha-interop.war file in the subfolder 'dist/war'. Copy this 
to the webapps folder of tomcat and start the tomcat server. Now you are ready to run
the Sandesha interop client. Start your web browser and go to URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/sandesha-interop/interop.jsp">http://localhost:8080/sandesha-interop/interop.jsp</a>
This should show you the interop client web page.
</p>
<p>
Most of the fields in this web page are self-explanaitory. First you can set the 
target field to any valid target URL. After this choose the operation Ping or echoString accordingly. 
The AcksTo field represents the wsrm:acksTo value. If acksTo is anonymous the 
acknowledgements will be sent in a synchronous path. You can also set the 
fields From, To and ReplyTo which represent wsa:from, wsa:to and wsa:replyTo respectively. ReplyTo should say where you expect to receive applications responses. 
FaultTo URL should point to the location you expect to receive faults.
Finally you can mention weather the client should send a sequence offer which 
is the sequence id of the response path, and the number of application messages you wish to send to the server.
